# Moving To Gitlab

[Victory Icon Theme on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/newhoa/victory-slim-for-gmusicbrowser)

I am in the process of moving this project, as well as my other Github projects, to Gitlab. I will leave the files here for a month or two. After that I may leave the Readme with this redirect notice or delete my account. Thank you all for your stars, watches, suggestions, kind comments and everything else. I really do appreciate it. I hope if you're reading this and have a Gitlab account you will find me there. I may also eventually mirror it on Bitbucket.
